## 1. Project Overview

This project requires the development of a comprehensive note management web application that allows users to create, organize, edit, and share notes. The application must support various content formats including text, images, and attached files. The system will feature user authentication, note organization with labels, search functionality, collaboration features, and offline capabilities.

**Important Notice**: Features highlighted in red in the original document must be implemented exactly as described. Any deviation, modification, or addition of features beyond those specified will result in disqualification from evaluation.

## 3. Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Allowed Technologies
- Frontend: Any libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, React)
- Backend: Any frameworks (e.g., Laravel)

### Implementation Notes
- A feature is considered fully completed only if it:
  - Functions as described
  - Includes error handling
  - Avoids critical security vulnerabilities
  - Adheres to industry best practices

### Coding Guidelines
- If not using Docker Compose or public deployment:
  - Use relative URLs instead of hardcoding (e.g., use `images/phone.jpg` instead of `http://localhost:8080/images/phone.jpg`)
  - Don't place project in subdirectories (serve directly at `http://localhost:8080/` not `http://localhost:8080/final_project/`)
  - For XAMPP, store files in `htdocs` directory, not in subfolders like `htdocs/final_project`
  - Don't hardcode port numbers in source code

- If using Docker Compose:
  - Include all necessary modules and configuration
  - Provide clear setup instructions

The project will be evaluated based on a 28-point rubric divided into four main sections:

1. **Account Management** (2.0 points)
   - 8 features worth 0.25 points each

2. **Simple Note Management** (4.0 points)
   - 12 features worth 0.25-0.5 points each

3. **Advanced Note Management** (2.0 points)
   - 4 features worth 0.5 points each

4. **Additional Requirements** (2.0 points)
